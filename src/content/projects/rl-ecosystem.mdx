## Problem
Stakeholders needed a transparent view of the Risk Labs ecosystem's health, specifically focusing on looping strategies and asset flowing.

## Approach

- Indexed contract interactions for key pools.
- Visualized utilization rates and TVL changes over time.

## Outcome
Became a primary source of truth for the community to track ecosystem growth and user adoption.
