## Problem
Disparate data sources were making it difficult to perform unified analysis and reporting, leading to inconsistent insights and slow decision-making.

## Approach
Designed and implemented a scalable data warehouse.
- Built robust ETL pipelines to ingest data from multiple sources.
- Implemented dimensional data modeling (Star Schema) for efficient querying.
- Performed in-depth analysis to drive business intelligence.

## Outcome
Established a single source of truth for data, significantly improving reporting accuracy and enabling self-service analytics.
