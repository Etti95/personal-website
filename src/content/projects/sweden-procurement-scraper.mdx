## Problem
Needed a reliable, automated way to ingest Swedish public procurement notices from the EU's TED API v3, overcoming complex query syntax and field mapping challenges to ensure access to contract award data.

## Approach
Built a resilient, production-ready Python pipeline.
- Implemented robust `tenacity` retry logic for API stability.
- Designed an idempotent `SQLAlchemy` database schema to prevent duplicates.
- Created a `typer` CLI for easy daily operations and backfilling.
- Solved critical API field mapping issues for "Contract Award" notices (flattened JSON structures).

## Outcome
A reliable, containerized scraper that runs daily updates, ensuring zero data loss and providing a structured SQL database for downstream analysis.
