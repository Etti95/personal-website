## Problem
Managing recipes and planning meals for the week was a manual, disjointed process. I wanted a centralized solution to store recipes and generate shopping lists automatically.

## Approach
Built a Next.js application with a clean UI.
- Implemented a custom recipe parser.
- Designed a drag-and-drop meal planner.
- Used local storage for data persistence.

## Outcome
A functional prototype that I use weekly. It streamlines the grocery shopping process and reduces food waste.
