## Problem
Raw data from various sources often contains inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting errors. Manual cleaning is prone to error and time-consuming.

## Approach
Created a Python-based web app using Streamlit.
- Users upload CSV/Excel files.
- The app applies standard cleaning rules (deduplication, normalization).
- Provides a downloadable, clean report.

## Outcome
 drastically reduced the time spent on data preparation for analysis tasks, allowing for faster insights.
